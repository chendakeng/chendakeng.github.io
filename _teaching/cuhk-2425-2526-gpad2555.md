This course examines the complex dynamics between state and society in contemporary China. Drawing from both classical works and recent research, students will explore how the Chinese State interacts with and maintains control over society, while adapting to social, economic, and political challenges. The course covers key dimensions of state-society relations through four interconnected aspects: development and social transformation, formal and informal institutions, control and resistance, and information management and digital control. Through these interconnected aspects, students will develop both theoretical understanding and analytical skills to examine political dynamics in the Chinese context. The course emphasizes both China's unique features and broader implications for understanding state-society relations in comparative politics.
