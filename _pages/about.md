# CHEN Dakeng, Devin | 陈达铿

I am a Post-doctoral Fellow at the School of Governance and Policy Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my BAs in Japanese Translation and Economics from the University of International Relations, my MSSc in Government and Politics from CUHK, and my PhD in Government and Public Administration from CUHK.

My research interests lie at the intersection of comparative politics, computational social science, and digital governance, with a particular focus on how technological advancement is reshaping social control practices and state-society interactions in China. Methodologically, I employ mixed-methods approaches that integrate computational techniques like machine learning and LLM-driven analysis, with traditional social science methods like surveys, econometrics analysis, and in-depth fieldwork.

My dissertation examined the effects of digital surveillance on citizen attitudes and behaviors in China, producing three articles:  one accepted by the *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, one under review at *Governance*, and the other under review at *The China Quarterly*. My current project utilizes LLMs to process millions of government records to systematically quantify and explain variations in local digital control deployment across China. Beyond my staple research, I collaborate across disciplines, applying computational approaches to projects in quantitative history, psychology, financial technology, and communication studies. 

I currently teach undergraduate courses on *Comparative Politics* and *State-Society Relations in China*, as well as postgraduate courses on *Institutions and Reforms in China* at CUHK.
