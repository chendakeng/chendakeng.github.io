# CHEN Dakeng, Devin | 陈达铿

I am a Post-doctoral Fellow at the School of Governance and Policy Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my BAs in Japanese Translation and Economics from the University of International Relations, my MSSc in Government and Politics from CUHK, and my PhD in Government and Public Administration from CUHK.

My research interests cover computational social science, comparative politics, and digital governance, with a particular focus on how technological advancement is reshaping governance practices and state-society interactions in China. My dissertation examined the effects of digital surveillance on citizen attitudes and behaviors in China, producing three articles: one accepted by the *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, one under review at *Governance*, and another under review at *The China Quarterly*. My current project utilizes LLMs to process millions of government records to systematically quantify and explain variations in digital control deployment across China. I also collaborate across disciplines, applying computational approaches to projects in quantitative history, psychology, financial technology, and communication studies.

I currently teach undergraduate courses on *Comparative Politics* and *State-Society Relations in China*, as well as a postgraduate course on *Institutions and Reforms in China* at CUHK.
