Digital surveillance is increasingly deployed by authoritarian regimes, but its effects on citizens’ behaviors and attitudes remain understudied. Beyond merely repressing or deterring regime opponents, we argue that pervasive digital surveillance creates an environment of constant monitoring that fosters widespread citizen compliance toward the regime. However, the compliance-inducing effects attenuate as citizens become habituated to surveillance. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork and employing a quasi-natural experiment with two pilot surveillance projects and two coinciding social surveys in China, we reveal digital surveillance’s paradoxical short- and long-term effects on citizen compliance. The empirical findings show that newly introduced surveillance significantly boosts public compliance with the regime. Over time, however, this effect diminishes, and even reinforced surveillance cannot sustain the initial surge in compliance. The findings highlight both the potency and limitations of digital surveillance as a tool of social control in authoritarian regimes.
