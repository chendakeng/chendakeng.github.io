Authoritarian regimes increasingly deploy digital surveillance to monitor citizens, but how this affects citizen compliance remains understudied. We argue that, beyond repressing or deterring regime opponents, digital surveillance serves as an instrument of everyday governance. It fosters routine compliance with the regime through pervasive monitoring and psychosocial pressure, although the compliance-inducing effect attenuates as citizens habituate and reassess risks of noncompliance. We test this argument against empirical evidence from China. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork and employing a quasi-natural experiment enabled by two pilot surveillance projects that coincided with two national social surveys, we reveal digital surveillanceâ€™s paradoxical short- and long-term effects: Newly introduced surveillance significantly boosts citizen compliance. Over time, however, this effect diminishes, and even reinforced surveillance cannot sustain the initial surge in compliance. The findings highlight both the potency and the limits of digital surveillance as a tool of authoritarian governance.
