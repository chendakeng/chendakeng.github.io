The Chinese state has aggressively deployed digital technologies to enhance its surveillance over society. However, grassroots governments exhibit divergent patterns in selecting between digital and traditional surveillance tools. This study examines local authorities’ surveillance strategies to monitor and control residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period marked by heightened state control over population mobility and intensive use of digital tools like health and travel codes. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork and comparative case studies of four urban and rural communities, we find that the surveillance strategies of grassroots governments are significantly shaped by the breadth and depth of social networks. Whereas modern urban communities with atomized residents rely primarily on digital surveillance, established communities with robust social networks favor traditional methods involving human agents operating through different layers of community networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that digital surveillance inevitably replaces traditional control measures. We argue that, despite technological advancements, human agents remain quintessential for effective authoritarian control.
