How does revolutionary sacrifice translate into political and economic privilege? While existing research emphasizes martyrdomâ€™s role in state legitimation, systematic empirical studies examining whether these sacrifices are compensated equally remain limited. Using structured schema-based classification with large language models, we compiled a novel historical dataset of over 2 million war martyrs with detailed biographical and geographic information. By analyzing these granular data across more than 2,800 county-level administrative units, we investigate how revolutionary sacrifice shapes state resource allocation, including economic compensation and political cadre selection. The findings reveal that revolutionary sacrifice significantly enhances local access to economic compensation and opportunities for cadre promotion. However, these effects exhibit substantial heterogeneity: regions where sacrifices primarily composed of rank-and-file soldiers experience limited economic or political benefits, whereas regions with high-ranking martyrs secure substantial advantages. These findings reveal profound inequalities in revolutionary state-building, where elite sacrifices are disproportionately valued over broader popular contributions, demonstrating endogenous dynamics through which elite valorization both entrenches existing hierarchical inequalities and cultivates collective legitimacy narratives. This research provides novel empirical evidence and theoretical insights on how revolutionary legacies shape long-term patterns of resource distribution, contributing to ongoing debates of endogenous state-building in revolutionary regimes.
